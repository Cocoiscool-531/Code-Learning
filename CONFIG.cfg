RAND_MODE:
Changes between the randomized vector being sequential 
(0-elements)(no repeats) and then randomzied, or the 
vector being fully random, which may have repeated 
elements. This will pick [elements] number of
random numbers between 0 and [max].

Elements is the number of elements to have in the vector

Set mode to 0 to use sequential mode
Set mode to any other number to make it fully random. The value will equal the max size of an element
RAND_MODE=

Set elements to a positive int
